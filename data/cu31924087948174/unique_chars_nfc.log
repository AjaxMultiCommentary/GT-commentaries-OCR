In this there is a reminiscence of Aeschylean boldness ;indeed, it is doubtful whether anything in the extant plays ofupon this arrangement, if when he composed the Ajax the taste ofthe Ajax, in respect of subject and spirit, may be compared to theOedipus Coloneus. Both appeal, in different ways, more directlythan the other five plays, to Athenian patriotism 1, and both breathefall under the displeasure of the gods. In both there are elaboratecomprises the struggle and the reconcilement in successive acts, whilethe Oedipus at Colonus is wholly, like the Philoctetes, a drama ofand Haemon or the Watchman in the Antigone.

But theColoneus moves deeper questionings, and, as already said, the Ajaxtragedy.
